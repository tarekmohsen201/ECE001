        <h1>Types of Artificial intelligence :-</h1>
        <p><strong>1:- Superior artificial intelligence :-</strong> 
            Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines supreme intelligence as “an idea that is much smarter than the best human minds in almost every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.” Because of this type, the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting field to delve into.<strong>2- Narrow artificial intelligence :-</strong> 
            It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field. For example, there are artificial intelligence systems that can beat the world champion of chess, and it's the only thing you do.
           <strong>3:- General artificial intelligence</strong> 
            This type refers to computers with the level of human intelligence in all areas, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform, the creation of this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not yet reached this level . 
           In the 21st century, AI research has become highly specialized and technical, and it has been divided into deeply sub-independent domains that they are so few to each other. The field sections grew around specific institutions, researchers worked, to solve specific problems, and differences of opinion a long time ago emerged about how artificial intelligence should work and widely applied various tools.
