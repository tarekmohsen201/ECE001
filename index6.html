        <h1>Artificial intelligence problems: -</h1>
        <p>reasoning, logical reasoning, ability to solve problems, representation of knowledge, hypothetical thinking and qualification problem, the mechanism of action of natural language, movement and possibility of change, perception, general intelligence is fair, most researchers hope that their work will eventually be combined into a machine image  With general intelligence '(known as strong artificial intelligence), combining all the aforementioned skills and exceeding most or all of human capabilities, some believe that this project requires artificial human features such as artificial awareness or artificial brain.  Many of the problems mentioned above are an integral part of the issue of complete artificial intelligence: to solve one problem, all of these problems must be solved.  For example, a specific task like machine translation requires the machine to follow the writer's (mind) opinion, know what is being talked about (knowledge), and rewrite the intention of the writer faithfully (a social intelligence).  Therefore, it is believed that machine translation is closely related to TI: strong AI may need to be translated as human .</p>
