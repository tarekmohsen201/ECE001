        <p>    By the end of Artificial Intelligence we can Understand what is it and why is it very important now days , its applications and use cases and how it is changing our lives, Explain terms such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks, Describe several issues and ethical concerns surrounding artificial intelligence, Articulate advice from experts about learning and starting a career in artificial intelligence .

            Now days Artificial intelligences existed and separated in all world either in developing countries and it changes their life and lives for better, Several techniques are used in artificial intelligence including search and math optimization models, reasoning, probability-based approaches, and economics. The fields of Artificial intelligence draws on computer science , linguistics mathematics, neuro-science, psychology , philosophy, artificial psychology and a lot of fields more. Need for Artificial intelligence, To build expert systems with the capability that exhibit intelligent actions or  To create expert systems which exhibit intelligent behavior with the capability to learn, demonstrate, explain and advice its users. Helping machines find solutions to complex problems like humans do and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly manner.
